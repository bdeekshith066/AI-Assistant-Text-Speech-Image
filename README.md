# AI-Assistant-Text-Speech-Image

This repository contains a Python script for an AI assistant capable of generating text, speech, or image responses based on user input. The assistant utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model for text generation and the Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) library for speech synthesis. Additionally, it integrates with the ClipDrop API for generating images from text prompts.

### Features:
- **Text Response:** Users can receive textual responses generated by the GPT-3.5 model based on their input queries.
- **Speech Response:** Users have the option to receive spoken responses synthesized from the generated text using gTTS.
- **Image Response:** Users can request image responses derived from their input prompts, facilitated by the ClipDrop API.

### Dependencies:
- **OpenAI API:** The `openai` library is used to interact with the GPT-3.5 model for text generation.
- **gTTS:** Google Text-to-Speech library for converting text responses into speech.
- **Requests:** Used for making HTTP requests to the ClipDrop API for generating image responses.
- **IPython:** Required for displaying audio files within Jupyter Notebooks.

### Installation:
Ensure the following dependencies are installed before running the script:
```bash
pip install openai==0.27.0 gtts
pip install requests
```
For speech-related functionalities, additional installations may be required:
```bash
pip install pydub SpeechRecognition
apt-get install -y python3-pyaudio
```
